Having moved from Windows to Mac I am finding out that certain keystroke
combinations that came naturally when editing raw text (not an Office document) are 
now different on a Mac – I found myself lost when trying to create en-dashes and em-dashes. 

While these keystrokes came naturally to me on Windows, I am happy to say that they 
are even easier to type—and make more sense—on a Mac.

## For Mac
* en-dash – `⌥ Opt`+`-` 
* em-dash – `⌥ Opt`+`⇧ Shift`+`-`
 
## For Windows
* en-dash – `Alt`+`0` `1` `5` `0` (on the numeric keypad)
* em-dash – `Alt`+`0` `1` `5` `1` (on the numeric keypad)
