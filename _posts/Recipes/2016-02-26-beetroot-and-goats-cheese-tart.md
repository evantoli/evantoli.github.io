Veronika discovered this recipe a while back when looking for new ideas with
beetroot and it is a favourite in our house. We often make two so that we can have it for
lunch the next day.

She made this for a friend of hers who hated beetroot (we didn't know). He had devoured a piece
before asking what this amazing tart was and as he was eating his second piece told
us how upset he was because despising beetroot had been an integral part of
his identity. In the end he decided that reconciling with beetroot was better than
forgoing this tart.
